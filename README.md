A bit about myself: My name is Ruthless Sushi. But I am actually not a sushi. I come from a city in India. I wish to become an awesome programmer and software engineer. I have a big interest in cybersecurity and web development. But I first want to experience all types of domains in this everchanging field. If you read this and think you can help me or I can help you, feel free to reach out ðŸ˜ƒ. I love to help people.
